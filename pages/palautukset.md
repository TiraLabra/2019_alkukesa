## Submissions
All submissions are done using github. No submissions will be considered through any other channels. First create a github repository for your project and then register with labtool.

A guide for using labtool can be found [here](labtool.md).

## Weekly submissions
A (significant) part of the course points are available based on the weekly activity. When the weekly deadline is approaching you should make sure that your repository is up to date and that you have created a weekly report. The project will only be graded once a week but it is a good idea to push you changes to the reposotory ar least at the end of every day of development.

## Weekly reports and hour reporting
The weekly report should be between half a page and 2 pages long. The reports should be added to the same subdirectory of the repository as all other documentation and is named intuitively e.g. "week 1 report.md". Besides the things below, you should add an approximate number of hours used for the course to each weekly report. The time spend on the coursework does not affect the grading.

The report should be a markdown document.

You can either work on the weekly report as you work on the project durign the week or just write the full report before each weeks deadline.

Here are some example questions that you can answer in the weekly reports:
- What have you done this week?
- How has the project progressed?
- What did you learn this week / today?
- What has been inclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
- What next?

You can also add direct questions and feedback to the course assistant to the weekly report. These will hopefully be answered in the labtool feedback.
