# Git resources

Git is a commonly used version control tool, that you will need at least for completing project work. Using version control, all the previous versions of files are available and can be returned should anything go wrong with the project.

There are a lot of excellent guides and videos on the internet for learning git.

A good guide for getting started is [TryGit](http://try.github.io/) by gitHub.
