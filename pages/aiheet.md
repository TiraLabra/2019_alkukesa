# Topics

You can either come up with your own topic or pick one from the ones below. The topics below are just examples, you can modify them if you want. The final topic will be decided with the help of, and approved by, the course assistant. Some more ideas may be found from older course [pages](https://github.com/TiraLabra/).

## Graphs and pathfinding

* How to find the fastest way possible out of a labyrinth. The labyrinth could be ASCII-art or a picture.

* How to find the fastest/shortest path between two nodes in a grapth. The nodes could be for isntance street addresses, bus stops or coordinates. See this article if interested: http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/AStarComparison.html
* Note: Just A-star is not a sufficient topic. But you could for instance compare different path finding algorithms.

* Maps for pathfinding can be found at [Moving AI Lab](http://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/) and the [downloads site](http://kartat.kapsi.fi/) for the National Land Survey of Finland.

* Public transit data [https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) or [https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/) and open map data [https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) have also been popular.

## Data compression

* How to compress a given file as efficiently as possible? A desired outcome would be at least a 40-60 % reduction in size. And the file has to be inflatable back to the original. How well can your implementation fare compared to existing solutions?
    * Huffman
    * Lempel Ziv

## AI

* Chess, Go, expanded naughts and crosses and so on are fun and challenging games. Can you create an AI that can play against a human opponent as well as agains itself? How good is it?

* For chess, working implementations have been seen using [xboard](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/) and [Lichess api](https://lichess.org/blog/WvDNticAAMu_mHKP/welcome-lichess-bots).

* Rock-paper-scissors ia a very familiar game. Can you create an AI that beats a person? How about Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Pierre_ciseaux_feuille_l%C3%A9zard_spock_aligned.svg and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8

* A slover for the well-known 15 puzzle. The 15 puzzle can be a bit challenging. Can you create a program that solves any 15 puzzle very fast? How about bigger play areas? http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle

* [halite](https://halite.io/) AI. Or any other similar online AI challenge.

## Dungeon generator
* A fairly popular topic is creating dungeons for games such as Rogue or NetHack. There exist several algorithms that can be implemented or you could just roll your own. Generation can be either entirely done before hand or be dynamic.


## Data structure comparisons
* There are many different data structures that do basically the same thing. Which of them is best for some given problems? Compare some (for example 4) different data structures and see what happens.


## Encryption and security
* Security is a very important topic in the modern world. There are many different ways to encrypt or hash data for many different reasons. This website has many ideas related to this topic: http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/index.php

* There are many ways to attack compressed, encrypted or hashed data. The above link contains some ideas for this as well. Or how about using frequency analysis to analyze an encrypted file? This is also very closely related to Huffman compression: http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/frequency.php


## Signal processing (images, sound)
* Implement one or more signal processign algorithms and report on your findings. Note that this may require some background knowledge of linear algebra.

## Something else
* The logistics company FastFreight wants to minimize the space wasted when packing containers. How can you calculate how to pack containers as efficiently as possible given a number of packages with given sizes?

* Design and implement a regular expression engine. Why? Read this for an answer: http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/10-reasons-to-learn-and-use-regular-expressions
